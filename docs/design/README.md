# Design

## Quick design from a pic

- Chrome capture other website(xiuqiu.com) performance page, save it to a.png
- https://v0.dev ->Upload a.png ->Build a website homepage as a.png ->Download a.zip
- unzip a.zip to v0.dev_npx/

## Convert Next.js/React to reflex framework
- #codebase .
  Analysis docs/desgin/v0.dev_nextjs/. It's a Next.js/React builded website code.

  Fetch [Reflex Framework Docs](https://reflex.dev/docs/getting-started/introduction/) and [Reflex framework source](https://github.com/reflex-dev/reflex) by context7 MCP.

  Now Convert it to a reflex framework website at current project.

- Fetch [Reflex Doc for Responsive Style](https://reflex.dev/docs/styling/responsive) by context 7 MCP.

  **Responsive Design:** ensure that the application will work well on all device sizes, with optimized layouts for mobile, tablet, and desktop views. The sidebar will be hidden by default on mobile and can be toggled with a hamburger menu, while on desktop it can be collapsed or expanded as needed.

- Add siderbar collapsed/expand toggle button/icon at left-top 'Home' icon's right.

- When siderbar collapsed, hover tooltip will show info on icon's right.



## Why v0.dev cannot directly use reflex to build website.
**v0 is specifically designed for Next.js and React applications only**. The platform runs in a browser-based "Next.js" runtime that executes JavaScript/TypeScript, not Python.

**Why I cannot build with Reflex:**
- Reflex is a Python-based framework that requires a Python server runtime
- v0's Code Projects only support Next.js/React with JavaScript/TypeScript
- The preview environment cannot execute Python web applications
- Reflex apps need a backend Python process, which isn't available in v0's browser-based environment

**Your options:**
1. **Continue with the current Next.js implementation** - I can continue improving the stock trading platform with the modern React/Next.js stack (which is what we've been building)
2. **Download and convert manually** - You can download the current Next.js code and manually rebuild it in Reflex in your local environment
3. **Use v0 for React/Next.js only** - Keep using v0 for JavaScript/TypeScript web applications


## Create relate tables & fields
Analysis app_guotai.py, it use to get real-time data from mobile app by two function:
- get_from_app_quote_page()
- get_from_app_position_page()

1. Above two function return fields with relate values, will need to saved in db/imobile.sql.

2. Analysis db/imboile.sql, how to create relate tables or append/modify fields to can save all these real-time return data.

3.When you sure can save all these real-time return data, create a save_app_data_to_db() in app_guotail.py for save them to db.


## migration when db schemas changes
Fetch [Reflex DB Doc](https://reflex.dev/docs/database/overview#migrations) by context7 MCP.
do better migration when db schemas changs.


## Modify db schemas
